/// Comprehensive event handlers for DOO chat interactions.
///
/// DOOCallbacks provide a reactive way to handle various events that occur
/// during the lifecycle of a DOO client instance. These callbacks enable you
/// to build responsive UIs, handle real-time updates, and manage errors gracefully.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// final callbacks = DOOCallbacks(
///   onWelcome: () {
///     print("Connected to DOO");
///     setState(() => connectionStatus = "Connected");
///   },
///   onMessageReceived: (message) {
///     print("New message: ${message.content}");
///     setState(() => messages.add(message));
///     NotificationService.showNotification(message.content);
///   },
///   onMessageSent: (message, echoId) {
///     print("Message sent: $echoId");
///     // Replace optimistic message with confirmed one
///     updateMessageWithEchoId(echoId, message);
///   },
///   onError: (error) {
///     print("DOO Error: ${error.cause}");
///     showErrorSnackBar(error.cause);
///   },
/// );
/// 
/// final client = await DOOClient.create(
///   baseUrl: "https://your-instance.doo.ooo",
///   inboxIdentifier: "your_inbox",
///   callbacks: callbacks,
/// );
/// ```
///
/// ## Event Categories

/// - [onMessageSent]: Confirmation of sent message
/// - [onMessageUpdated]: Existing message was modified
///
/// ### Conversation State
/// - [onConversationStartedTyping]: Agent is typing
/// - [onConversationStoppedTyping]: Agent stopped typing
/// - [onConversationIsOnline]: Agent is online
/// - [onConversationIsOffline]: Agent went offline
///
/// ### Data Events
/// - [onMessagesRetrieved]: Bulk message load completed
/// - [onPersistedMessagesRetrieved]: Cached messages loaded
///
/// ### Error Handling
/// - [onError]: Any error occurred during operation
